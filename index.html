  <h3>PhD student | Tutor | Noob webdev</h3>

  <p>Hi, I'm Bailey. I'm a PhD student at the University of York. To read more about my research, click <a href="https://fusion-cdt.ac.uk/student/bailey-cook/" target="_blank" title="Bailey Cook — Fusion CDT">here</a>. I'm making this site because I'm interesting in learning more about how modern web development works. Eventually, I'd this to serve as a place for me to upload blog posts and advertise my tutoring services. Currently though, it's very much a work in progress!</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/BaileyCook" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileycook/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/baiway" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
