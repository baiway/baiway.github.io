  <p>I'm currently offering online tution and in-person tuition in York. My availability varies throughout the year, but I'm generally available most weekday evenings and Sunday mornings. If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:bailey.cook@sky.com" target="_blank" title="mailto:bailey.cook@sky.com">email me</a>.</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I've been tutoring since November 2015 and in that time have tutored more than 50 students across a wide range of ages and abilities. I'm also a qualified teacher; I earned my PGCE in Physics and Mathematics from King's College London in 2018 and worked in London as a secondary school Physics teacher for three years after that (one year in an inner city comprehensive and two years at a leading independent day school). I have taught students at all stages, including (I)GCSE, A level, AEA Mathematics, IB, AP and Pre-U. I've also supported students with university applications, including personal statement feedback, mock interviews and guidance for admissions such as the PAT (for Physics and Engineering admissions to Oxford), ECAA (for Economics admissions to Cambridge), NSAA (for Natural Sciences admissions to Cambridge) and also the British Physics Olympiad (BPhO). In addition, I have helped prepare students Common Entrance and scholarship examinations at top independent schools such as Eton and Westminster.

    I believe students learn best when they feel comfortable asking questions, so I try to create a calm environment where they feel they can speak freely and make mistakes without consequence. The structure of my lessons varies depending on the strengths and goals of the student, but generally speaking I try to frame the teaching segments as "conversations" and the practice segments as "expositions" given by the student (rather than me) in which they explain their thinking out loud, and students tend to find this approach helpful. The teaching segments typically involve a lot of questioning and back-and-forth to tease out and correct misconceptions. Once the student has a good grasp of whatever we're covering, we'll turn to some external resource (e.g. homework, textbook questions or exam questions) to validate this. I ask students to 'think out loud' when we're working through questions and I've found this helps them to think more clearly and, over the long term, leads to improvements in their confidence (both personal and academic) and oracy.

    Whilst I loved teaching and still do, I left the profession in 2021 to pursue a PhD in physics. My research focuses on simulating turbulence in hot, magnetised plasmas (the sort that will be found in future magnetically-confined fusion reactors). The promise of nuclear fusion as an energy resource is very exciting — an intrinsically safe means of meeting the grid's base load, with fuel reserves to last for thousands of years and no long-lived nuclear waste — and I'd be more than happy to discuss it with any interested students!
