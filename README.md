Work-in-progress personal website. I'm currently working through [Codecademy's Front-end Web Development course](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path-b/) to better understand the basics of web development. I'll be developing this site in tandem. 

Inspiration:
- [Gregory Gunderson's research blog](https://gregorygundersen.com)
- [Kevin Zhou's personal website](https://knzhou.github.io)
- [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com)
