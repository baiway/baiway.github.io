  <p>Hi, I'm Bailey. I'm a PhD student at the University of York. To read more about my research, click <a href="https://fusion-cdt.ac.uk/student/bailey-cook/" target="_blank" title="Bailey Cook — Fusion CDT">here</a>. I'm making this site because I'm interested in learning more about how modern web development works. Eventually, I'd this to serve as a place for me to upload blog posts and advertise my tutoring services. Currently though, it's very much a work in progress!</p>
