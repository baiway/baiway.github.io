This is the source code for my (work-in-progress) personal website. I'm using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) as a static site manager and I'm deploying the site using GitHub Pages (via GitHub Actions, see [Sophia Brandt's helpful guide](https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/) for more information on how to do this with 11ty).

Inspiration:
- [Gregory Gunderson's research blog](https://gregorygundersen.com). I absolutely love the simple style of Gregory's site so I borrowed a lot of his CSS (see [this post](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/) and links therein).
- [Hannah Tillim's personal website](https://www.hannahtillim.com). I'm also a big fan of Hannah's site. Her site plays a very similar role to my own, so I look a lot of inspiration from her site's style and structure.
- [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com). I'm a huge fan of Maggie's writing and her approach to note-taking.
