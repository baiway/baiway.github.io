Work-in-progress personal website. I'm using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) as a static site manager and deploying using GitHub Pages (via GitHub Actions, see [Sophia Brandt's helpful guide](https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/) on this for more information).

Inspiration:
- [Gregory Gunderson's research blog](https://gregorygundersen.com). I absolutely love the simple style of Gregory's site so I borrowed a lot of his CSS (see [this post](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/) and links therein).
- [Kevin Zhou's personal website](https://knzhou.github.io). I forget how I stumbled upon Kevin's website, but his was the first PhD profile website that I found. I also like that he uploads his tutoring resources to his site; I aim to eventually do something similar. 
- [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com). I'm a huge fan of Maggie's writing and her approach to note-taking. 
- Edward Tufte (see e.g. [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css)). Note: I am yet to implement sidenotes.
