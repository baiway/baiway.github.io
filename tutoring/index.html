  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I've been tutoring since November 2015 and in that time have tutored more than 50 students across a wide range of ages and abilities. I'm also a qualified teacher; I earned my PGCE in Physics and Mathematics from King's College London in 2018 and worked in London as a secondary school Physics teacher for three years after that (one year in an inner city comprehensive and two years at a leading independent day school). I have taught students at all stages, including (I)GCSE, A level, AEA Mathematics, IB, AP and Pre-U. I've also supported students with university applications, including personal statement feedback, mock interviews and guidance for admissions tests such as the PAT (for Physics and Engineering admissions to Oxford), ECAA (for Economics admissions to Cambridge), NSAA (for Natural Sciences admissions to Cambridge) and also the British Physics Olympiad (BPhO). In addition, I have helped several students win scholarships to top independent schools such as Eton and Westminster.
  </p>
  <p>
    My teaching style revolves around creating an interactive and engaging learning environment that makes students feel comfortable and empowered. I am a big fan of dialogic teaching and make heavy use of questioning in all my sessions to promote critical thinking and encourage students to voice their ideas. Encouraging students to 'think out loud' not only helps me to tease out and correct misconceptions more quickly, but also helps students to think more clearly and, over the long term, greatly improves their confidence (both academic and personal) and oracy. Ultimately, my goal is to help my students develop a deep understanding of the subject matter and refine their exam technique so they feel well-prepared for their examinations and further study.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst I loved teaching and still do, I left the profession in 2021 to pursue a PhD in physics. My research focuses on simulating turbulence in hot, magnetised plasmas (the sort that will be found in future magnetically-confined fusion reactors). The promise of nuclear fusion as an energy resource is very exciting — an intrinsically safe means of meeting the grid's base load, with fuel reserves to last for thousands of years and no long-lived nuclear waste — and I'd be more than happy to discuss it with any interested students!

            <p>Bailey tutored my son in A Level Physics for a year. I was really impressed as my son's grades improved dramatically by 2 levels. He got an A* and secured a place in one of UK's top universities. I cannot recommend Bailey highly enough.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Bailey has been amazing with my daughter as she prepares for her Physics GCSE. He has helped her achieve excellent grades and build her confidence. He is punctual, prepared and always provides helpful resources. He's also a very nice person and she feels comfortable and relaxed in the tutoring sessions which so important.</p>

            <p>Incredibly lucky to have found Bailey, having tried several which was a waste of time/money. Bailey helped my daughter with her confidence and in turn her grade moved up in her Maths IGCSE. He is also helping my son with Physics and Maths IGCSE now. Again, my son has thrived under Bailey's guidance. Bailey is professional, calm, and a fantastic tutor. Can't recommend him enough.</p>

            <p>Bailey is fantastic. Gets to my son's level, gets into his head, and gets him motivated to do well. Very pleased.</p>
